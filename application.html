<h1><u>Application Proccess</u></h1>
  <p><h3>Introduction</h3>
In preparation for you applying for a secondary school place for 2022/23 for your child, below is some further clarification of what information we would need from you if you applied to Trinity Catholic School.
<br>
<br>
As we are a faith school we do require some additional documentation from you.
<br>
<br>
All applications must be made on the Common Application Form provided by your home Local Authority. Applications must be made to your home Local Authority by the national closing date of 31 October.
<br>
<br>
Dependent on place of residence parents/carers should consult their relevant home Local Authority website for full details of the admissions process, including information on the admissions cycle. Details are below:
<br>
<br>
Nottinghamshire:<a href="www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk"> www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk</a>
<br>
<br>
Nottingham City:<a href="www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk"> www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk</a>
<br>
<br>
If you are applying on the basis of religion, once you have made your application on the Common Application Form with your home Local Authority, we need you to send us a copy of your child’s baptism certificate and a completed Supplementary Information Form. The form can be found at the bottom of this page. Please complete this form and return it directly to Trinity Catholic School along with a copy of the baptism certificate. These documents can be posted to the school or emailed to admissions@trinity.nottingham.sch.uk
<br>
<br>
Please be aware that if we do not receive the completed Supplementary Information Form and a copy of the baptism certificate by 31 October it could result in your child being placed in a lower admissions category in the oversubscription criteria and may affect your child’s chance of being offered a place.
<br>
<br>
If you are unsure of what is required or if you need any further information please call the school on 0115 929 6251 and press the ‘admissions’ option.

<h3> Documentation</h3>
Following allocations, parents/carers may appeal if they are not allocated a place for their child at their preferred school. Requests for appeals must be made in writing and addressed to the Admissions Officer at the relevant school. Appeals must be received by the school no later than twenty working days after the date of the refusal letter. The Catholic Schools Appeals Service arranges all appeals on behalf of the governing bodies of the Trinity Catholic School. Appeals will be heard by an independent panel and the final decision of the panel is binding on all parties.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to appeal, please email admissions@trinity.nottingham.sch.uk stating your child’s details and your reasons for appealing. This will be received by the Admissions Officer who will then contact the Catholic Schools Appeals Service.
