  <h1><u>Year 7 Subjects</u></h1>
  <p>
    <h3>Art</h3>
    Art and Design is a popular subject at Key Stages 4 and 5, with students following the Edexcel specifications. All students are encouraged to work independently, researching and organising information from a range of sources. They are required to record information using a range of materials, recording from both primary and secondary sources. All students are expected to develop their skills in a range of media including drawing, painting, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, digital photography and mixed media.
    <h3>Maths</h3>
    The Maths department at Trinity is an enthusiastic, highly achieving and supportive department. We are passionate about sharing our love of Maths with the students.
<br>
We have 10 members of staff who are all subject specialists, and we have a great wealth of experience within the team. All staff teach across the age range from Year 7 to Year 11 and 7 of our staff also teach A level.
<br>
We are a very forward thinking and collaborative team, utilising the best advances in educational practices to ensure our students develop a deep and secure understanding of Mathematics, make great progress and importantly enjoy their studies. We strongly believe that with encouragement, hard work and good teaching all students can make progress, achieve and enjoy their Mathematics.
<br>
We have strong links with our local Maths Hubs and with the University of Nottingham. We regularly work with the school of Education at the University of Nottingham hosting trainee teachers in their first and second placements. 
    <h3>Science</h3>
Science at Trinity has a strong tradition of being a popular, enjoyable and highly regarded subject. Our students make excellent progress and achieve very highly at both GCSE and A-Level.
    <h3>ICT</h3>
The ICT and Computing Department bridges the gap in IT knowledge from primary school to the real world. It offers Key Stage 3, GCSEs, A Levels, and BTECs in both ICT and Computer Science. IT is also deeply embedded throughout the school with many subjects using IT to teach their relevant courses.
    <h3>English</h3>
In English lessons, the core skills of speaking and listening, reading and writing are developed. We aim to produce students who are confident at expressing an opinion through speaking and writing, have ideas about the world around them and the texts they read, and can appreciate how language is used. We aim to give them the practical skills that will be essential for the world of work, as well as inspiring a love of the stories and ideas around them.
<br>
We are often asked how parents can help their children make better progress in English. Firstly, they can encourage their children to read, borrowing books from the school or local libraries. Wide and varied reading of different texts is vital if pupils are to develop their ideas, their imaginations and good styles of writing and speaking.
    <h3>Business</h3>
Business is a vibrant and dynamic subject.  It is an A-Level only qualification at Trinity.  Business enables students to develop as commercially minded and enterprising individuals and helps them to succeed in a variety of pathways.  
<br>
Business involves managing resources in order to achieve an organisation’s objectives. The organisation may be a National Health hospital, a state school, a large multinational company, a small shop or charity. The fundamental issue facing such an organisation is to decide how to make the best use of the limited resources at its disposal. In every business there will be a limited amount of finance, labour, expertise and technology etc. which can be utilised. Management has to decide how to get the most out of these resources.

<h1><u>Year 7 Pastoral Team</u></h1>
  <p>Introduction to Year 7 Progress Coordinator
I would like to welcome our future Year 7 students and their parents to The Trinity School, part of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Multi-Academy Trust. My intention is to populate this page with all the information you will need to join us in September.

I am really looking forward to you joining us at Trinity, but I understand it can be an anxious time for children (and even more so for the parents!) With that said, if you have a query, or would just like to get in touch and introduce yourself; please contact me directly via e-mail at a.holt@trinity.nottingham.sch.uk

<h3>Issie</h3>
My name is Issie and I’m one of the Lay Chaplains here at Trinity. I started working here in September 2019 and have loved every minute of it! This year I am in 4 days a week, and spend a day a week in our feeder primaries to ensure that we have those strong links of transition. My favourite thing about working here is probably our trips to The Briars and our retreat days, both of these allow our students to experience faith in different ways and to understand just how powerful a thing it can be.

<h3>Frances</h3>
Hey everyone! My name is Frances and I’m one of the Chaplains here at the Trinity School. When I am not in school you will catch me either in one of our feeder primary schools or at home with my two children. I absolutely love being a Lay Chaplain, especially because I get to know so many students all the way through! It’s great to watch them all grow and mature into such fantastic young people and support them in their faith journey along the way.

<h3>Luke</h3>
Hi Everyone! My name is Luke and I’m joining Fran and Issie as the new chaplain here at The Trinity School. As well as Trinity, I will also be going into our feeder primary schools with Fran and Issie so I’m really excited for this year.

<h3>The Chaplaincy Team</h3>
The Chaplaincy Team is open to everyone in school regardless of faith and age and allows students to be leaders in the Catholic Life of the School. As part of the team, students plan and lead Acts of Worship, organise and run fundraising events for CAFOD, take part in the Faith in Action award and so much more. It’s a truly invaluable experience and provides an incredible service for others too. We are so proud of our Chaplaincy Teams here, and have even had previous members go on to work at The Briars Catholic Youth Centre in Crich!

Every year we take groups up to The Briars Catholic Youth Centre to spend a few days on retreat, stepping back and spending some time God and each other. It’s a wonderful opportunity to connect and reflect, and something that so many of our pupils have found beneficial both spiritually and emotionally. We also take groups on pilgrimage to Lourdes in the summer with the Diocese, fundraising to get there and assisting the sick and elderly whilst there. This is an incredibly rewarding trip for our sixth form students and a once in a lifetime opportunity.
