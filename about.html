  <h1><u>Brief History</u></h1>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>1844 - In 1844 the Sisters of Mercy came to Nottingham and opened St Mary's Elementary School and St Catherine's Day and Boarding School.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1962 - The current building on Beechdale Road was opened in 1962 when the Bishop asked the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, generally known as the Loreto Sisters, to take over the direction of the school due to increasing numbers of students.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1965 - With the ending of the all age schools and the increasing demand for secondary places, St. Mary's became a primary school and a new school named after Bishop Dunn was opened in Kingsbury Drive in 1965 to provide secondary education.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1975 - In 1975 the two schools amalgamated to become The Trinity School providing a comprehensive education for girls and boys.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1987 - The statue of Our Lady donated to us by the Sisters in 1987 has been sited at the entrance to the Loreto building (Beechdale Site). It is a constant reminder to us of the sacrifices and efforts made in the past on our behalf to establish Catholic education here for our children.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1988 - The School Badge, re-designed in 1988, encapsulates much of the school's tradition. The cross is derived from the Bishop's cross. The Fleur-de-lys represents the Loreto School and the Triangle the first symbol of The Trinity School. They are set in our colours of green, black, silver and gold. "Ad Dei Gloriam" our motto, "To the Glory of God", sums up the purpose for which we all work and means that in The Trinity School "only our best is good enough."</li>
    <br>
    <li>2017 - In January 2017 Trinity opened their new building to accommodate the growing number of students. The new building consists of rooms for Science, ICT, Geography, History, Business Studies and Physical Education.</li>

<h1><u>Rules</u></h1>
  <p><h3>1. Introduction</h3>
This policy is written with reference to the Trinity Catholic School’s Mission Statement:
“To the Glory of God, we build our school on faith, love and respect.”
In order to fulfil our Mission, good behaviour and conduct are vital and this is underpinned by maintaining consistently high standards of uniform and appearance.

<h3>2. Aims and Rationale</h3>
At the Trinity Catholic School by specifying school uniform we aim for straightforward and traditional styles to maintain consistency and avoid trends, we believe the school uniform achieves two important goals:
<br>
It encourages a sense of community identity and pride. By wearing the same badge and the same clothing, pupils are encouraged to think of the needs of the community as well as their own individual needs.
<br>
It prevents unkindness or bullying while keeping costs down. By requiring all our pupils to wear the same low-cost uniform, we reduce the incentive for pupils to ask parents for the latest (and most expensive) items of fashion. As a result, costs are kept as low as possible and no child can be seen to be poorer or wealthier than any other.
<h3>3. General Expectations and Standards</h3>

For our uniform policy to be successful, it must be implemented universally and without exception. Our parents understand this and so support us at home to uphold the school’s high standards.
<br>
Please make sure that every piece of uniform is clearly labelled with your child’s name. We cannot accept responsibility if any item is lost but will do our best to find it. We place great importance on a high standard of uniform and encourage pupils to take pride in it and themselves. We expect pupils to wear a clean shirt every day. We expect children to wash regularly and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene. Only non-glass roll-on deodorant may be brought into school.

<h3>7. Make-up Years 7-11</h3>

Pupils in Years 7 to 11 must not wear any make-up whatsoever. If found to be wearing make-up of any description pupils will be asked to remove it immediately. Failure to do so will result in an immediate sanction. Nail varnish of any description, as well as nail extensions, are similarly forbidden.

<h3>8. Jewellery</h3>

<br>
Inexpensive watches are acceptable. (Smartwatches are not allowed). Specific items that are not allowed:
<ul>
<li>Fashion badges.</li>
<li>Earrings or ear studs of any sort.</li>
<li>Piercings of any sort.</li>
<li>Bracelets including ankle bracelets.</li>
<li>Necklaces or chains.</li>
<li>Any ‘ear-piercing’ must be done at the start of the summer holidays, as ‘retainers’ can’t be worn in school.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Sixth Form Dress Code</h3>
The rest of the school has a smart and strictly enforced uniform and therefore, it is important that students adhere to the Sixth Form Dress Code as they are role models for the rest of the school and should dress appropriately. This includes:

<li>No facial piercings or tattoos visible.</li>

<li>Sensible footwear.</li>
<li>Hair colour and hairstyles must not be extreme.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Items of Religious Significance</h3>
The Headteacher may grant exceptions to any of the requirements set out in this policy, but only where this is required as a matter of sincere religious observance and where this can be substantiated by a letter from a priest or relevant religious leader.
<br>
<br>
<h3>11. Available Support</h3>
We understand that, for some families, finances are tight. We believe that, by doing all we can to keep items of fashion out of school, we help families to keep costs down. Nevertheless, if you do have an individual problem, or you are unsure about an item of clothing, please do not hesitate to contact your child’s Progress Coordinator who will deal with your enquiry in the strictest confidence.
<br>
Addendum for the transition period: 1st September 2021-31st August 2022
